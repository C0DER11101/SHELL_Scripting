Here, SDL is being used. So make sure to put [BreakTime.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/SHELL_Scripting/blob/ShellScript/PROJECT/P1/BreakTime.c), [BreakOver.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/SHELL_Scripting/blob/ShellScript/PROJECT/P1/BreakOver.c) and [LoadImg.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/SHELL_Scripting/blob/ShellScript/PROJECT/P1/LoadImg.c) in the same folder as [Remi.sh](https://github.com/C0DER11101/SHELL_Scripting/blob/ShellScript/PROJECT/P1/Remi.sh).


Here is the command to compile C program that's implementing SDL image using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc program.c -o program -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image
```


Also make sure to download the images from [P1](https://github.com/C0DER11101/SHELL_Scripting/issues/2).
