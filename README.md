## Who am I?

My name is **Priyanuj Bora** and I am a student who is  pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering.
I am currently in my _3rd year_.


### Why I want to learn Shell Scripting?

**Because:**
- I want to learn shell script to create my own commands and to make data backup easier and also for automation of tasks!!
- I find it fascinating!!

_May be what I just said could become a part of a project!!_
