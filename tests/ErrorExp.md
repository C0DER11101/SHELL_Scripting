# Error of [error1](https://github.com/C0DER11101/SHELL_Scripting/blob/ShellScript/errors/error1)

The shebang is used to define the interpreter program that will be used while executing the file.

In the case of "error1", we wrote #!/bin/bash which meant that the bash interpreter will be used while executing "error1".

So, since the bash interpreter will be used, and it doesnot recognize "Hello world", it show an error when we try to execute "error1".

Because bash recognizes "ls", "cd", "echo", etc...(the commands that we use in the terminal). So it throws an error:
