# Taking user input

### Note
>From this file onwards, the programs written in [test/](https://github.com/C0DER11101/SHELL_Scripting/tree/ShellScript/tests) will be linked.

We use the `read` command to take user input.

**By default, the input read by the `read` command is stored in a variable called REPLY.**

**REPLY is a shell variable.**
