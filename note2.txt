Variable:

name=value

value can be anything, e.g. string, command, file path, digits, etc.

Who creates variables and uses them: Processes.

Linux has two types of variables:
a) Environment variable.
b) Shell variables.

When an environment variable is created then the subsequent processes can also use that variable.
Environment variable can be created by any process(including the shell process).

The shell variable can only be created by the shell process. Here the subsequent processes won't be able to use that variable.

To see all the environment variables that have already been set, you need to type:

~$ env

You can also use:

~$ printenv

If you want to create your own environment variables, type:

~$ export NAME="whoami"

Now, whoami is a command of Linux which shows you your username.
But now, you don't have to write 'whoami', just type:

~$ $NAME

and everything will be done!!

To remove the environment variable, type the following command:

~$ unset NAME

This will the environment variable NAME

SHELL VARIABLES
